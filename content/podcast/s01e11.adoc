In this eleventh episode Ezra and Peter discuss the June Community Update and interview content creator Linux Lounge! They also discuss (your) community feedback and questions!

== What have we been up to lately?

* Ezra:
** is releasing a https://gamejolt.com/games/Televoid_out_of_the_loop/377460[game]!
*** It's nearly done! It should be released June 22nd if no serious issues arise. Otherwise, shortly after.
*** The game is, of course, open source. So, you can make fun of my horrifying code.
*** It's a mysterious adventure filled with a handful of minigames, a short story and minimal moon logic.
*** It's called "Televoid: Out of The Loop" and is a fangame for a show I enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhU-0YgDyJY&list=PL290QH8A1p-SdZ54seS-LG_4G0AyDoXzG[Televoid], an online series staring Ian MacLeod on his https://www.youtube.com/user/brutalmoose[YouTube Channel]. To show our appreciation of this amazing series, some fans and I got together to make this game.
*** It's pretty much consumed my life these past few weeksâ€¦
*** After the released, I might have some fun and see if I can't port it to the pinephone, for the giggles. otherwiseâ€¦
** I've also been back on the video making train!

==== @PitrusCitrus@mastodon.social asks

_Question to the both of you @talkpine. What is a project you want to see on the pinephone that can be realistically done by a beginner programmer who's looking to get their hands dirty and expand their skillset? Be it practical, cool or just plain fun, throw us some ideas!_ See https://mastodon.social/@PitrusCitrus/106355073466197926[here]

* We crowdsourced this question on Discord, Twitter and (most successfully) Fosstodon, and came up with the following (thanks again!)
