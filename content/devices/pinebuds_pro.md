## The PineBuds Pro

The PineBuds Pro are open firmware capable ANC wireless earbuds. Some of the notable features include their light weight, 3 Microphones, ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), ENC (Environment Noise Cancellation) and high fidelity 6mm speaker. It is a fully community-driven side-project which anyone can contribute to, allowing you to keep control of your device even though hardware is proprietary.
