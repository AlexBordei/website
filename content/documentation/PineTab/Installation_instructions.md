For instructions on how to install the operating systems to the eMMC or microSD card see [Installation instructions](/documentation/PinePhone/Installation_instructions). The information is almost the same for the PineTab, as it is a very similar device. Do not try to use the PinePhone images though, use the PineTab images linked above.
