The Pine store has official cases:

* [PinePhone Hard Protective Case](https://pine64.com/?product=pinephone-hard-protective-case&v=0446c16e2e66)
* [PinePhone Soft TPU Protective Case](https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-soft-tpu-protective-case)

Tight-fit cases of other phones can’t be used with the PinePhone because most times the proportions and/or camera notch won’t fit. The phone can however be used with most "phone sleeves", such as those from fitBAG. The sleeve from fitBAG for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro fits the PinePhone tightly.

The OtterBox uniVERSE Case for Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro is [reported to fit the PinePhone well](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=17580&pid=114227) without much modification.
