== Kernel/driver TODOs
These exist, but they haven't been written down yet.

== Artifacting

There is some artifacting with the current driver that has been difficult to diagnose and resolve. The github issue tracking this is here: https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/issues/47

Some members of the community have been considering hiring an e-ink professional to consult on this issue. The thought is to hire someone with expertise in developing drivers for e-ink displays to provide advice and pointers, not to do the actual work (because that's expensive).

== Userspace TODOs

The TODOs in this space are organized around what functionality they enable. A table of the important functions that a user may want in the PineNote and a status are listed below:

|===
| Functionality | Approaches (apps) | Level of support (subjective) | Supports | Does not yet support | Notes

.2+| Reading Documents
| `https://github.com/koreader/koreader[Koreader]`
| Great
| Fully featured ebook reader; Supports many filetypes;
| Handwritten notes
| Large user base on many devices; codebase has a somewhat of a reputation for being messy

| `https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp[Xournalpp]`
| Good
| Reading/writing PDFs and other files;
| No definition support (long-press for definition)
| Billed more as a note-taking app than a document reading app
|===

=== Themes

A lot of getting the PineNote to work nicely will be theming things appropriately. Please list themes for various components here:

==== GNOME

Untested: https://github.com/fujimo-t/gnome-shell-theme-e-ink

==== GTK

TODO

=== GNOME Configurations

See link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Apps#gnome[here].

=== Sway Configurations

See link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Apps#sway[here].

== Documentation TODOs

* Pin Mesa Packages so they don't update when we upgrade other packages
** Add the information near step 5 link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Building_kernel#steps_to_build[here].
* Control the backlight
* Building alacritty correctly
* Force a screen refresh?
** See conversation here: https://matrix.to/#/!QtTzSRYMuozjbOQkzJ:matrix.org/$tfumBpnP2UPouNpaeFrggR40ZkrD_pHAtJdQmQvzL-o?via=matrix.org&via=kde.org&via=tchncs.de

This table is a draft for the documentation development page:

[cols="1,1,1,1,2"]
|===
| Functionality | Component | Status (Android from factory) | Status (Linux) | Notes

| Bootloader
| `Bootloader`
|  Android only
|  WIP for Linux
| Booting into linux requires a patched U-Boot. link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Booting_Linux[Instructions here.]

.4+| Operating System

| `Stability`
2+| WIP
| Users have successfully booted Arch, Manjaro, and Debian. Debian has most support right now.

| `Suspend`
2+| Works
| https://gitlab.com/hrdl/pinenote-shared/-/blob/main/patches/linux/0001-Rudimentary-attempt-to-keep-PMIC-usable-after-suspen.patch[This kernel patch] adds suspend support.

| `Updates`
2+| WIP
| GPU libs (mesa) and mutter rely on patched packages. These should not be updated via the package manager at the moment, make sure to exclude them.

| `Networking`
2+| Works
|

.5+| Components

| `E-Paper Display`
2+| WIP
| Mostly functional. There is some ghosting and work remains, but the device and screen are usable.

| `Touch`
2+| Works
|

| `Bluetooth`
2+| Works, audio stutters
| link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Building_kernel#fixing_bluetooth[Switching the driver] provides stable connections for keyboards, but audio still stutters. Trying to fix this link:/documentation/PineNote/Development/Software_tweaks#preliminary_fix_for_stuttering_bluetooth_audio[here].

| `Sensors`
2+| Unsure
| Light sensors? Rotational sensors?

| `Buttons`
2+| Works
| Power button works.

| Accessory compatibility, spare parts

| `Spare parts`
