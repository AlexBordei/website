This article seeks to provide general mainline Linux development information for the link:/documentation/PineNote[PineNote].

== Mainline development

=== Status

The following table aims to provide a list of kernel modules required for running the PineNote. It also aims at listing repositories of work in progress. While some overlap with the Quartz64 module list (link:/documentation/Quartz64/Development#upstreaming_status[Development]) is expected, only modules relevant to the PineNote hardware should be listed here.

Suspend on upstream TF-A (https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/16952[status]) should work without any special drivers.

=== Mainlining notes

Some work happening here: https://gitlab.com/calebccff/linux, the idea is to import the parts of the eink/ebc drivers which are open source and use the downstream u-boot framebuffer driver as a reference to create a basic framebuffer driver.

Currently mainline struggles to boot due to weird issues while probing fixed regulators (?). It also fails to detect eMMC.

Further work is being done here: https://github.com/smaeul/linux/commits/rk356x-ebc-dev. This has a complete device tree, with working eMMC. Pen input also works out of the box. Wi-Fi and BT work with firmware copied from the factory Android image.

== How to boot mainline

UART is currently REQUIRED for this to work|We depend on u-boot falling back to console. Once we have a prebuilt u-boot which will use extlinux by default, UART won't be needed anymore.

You can compile a u-boot that uses extlinux by default by following the instructions https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/pinenote_uboot/blob/aa9ecbd3d3e716f163f5a900824630f24e9f04ba/README.md#changing-default-boot-order[here].

=== Getting to a U-Boot prompt

You can get to a U-Boot prompt by:

. Holding Ctrl-C while the display panel initializes.
. Wiping the "boot" partition.

=== Using sysboot

The *extlinux.conf* should have the following contents:

 timeout 10
 default MAINLINE
 menu title boot prev kernel

 label MAINLINE
   kernel /vmlinuz
   fdt /rk3566-pinenote.dtb
   initrd /initramfs
   append earlycon console=tty0 console=ttyS2,1500000n8 fw_devlink=off PMOS_NO_OUTPUT_REDIRECT

At the U-Boot console, run the following command to boot your mainline kernel:

 sysboot ${devtype} ${devnum}:9 any ${scriptaddr} extlinux.conf

=== Booting with individual commands

Booting with individual commands can be useful when you need to temporarily add some kernel command line arguments. Use these or similar commands at the U-Boot shell:

 load mmc 0:b ${kernel_addr_r} boot/Image
 load mmc 0:b ${fdt_addr_r} boot/rk3566-pinenote.dtb
 setenv bootargs ignore_loglevel root=/dev/mmcblk0p11 rootwait init=/bin/bash
 booti ${kernel_addr_r} - ${fdt_addr_r}

== Configuration

=== Firmware for WiFi & Bluetooth and Waveform data

==== Using Maximilian's Debian image

If the Android partition (super) and waveform partition (waveform) is left intact the image extracts the WiFi, BT driver and waveform from the partitions on first run.

For instance if you repartitions the userdata partition and installs the image there.

==== Getting it from the Android install manually

Copy WiFi/BT firmware from Android:

 mkdir -p /cache/lib/firmware/brcm
 cp /vendor/etc/firmware/fw_bcm43455c0_ag_cy.bin /cache/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.bin
 cp /vendor/etc/firmware/nvram_ap6255_cy.txt /cache/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt
 cp /cache/lib/firmware/BCM4345C0.hcd /cache/lib/firmware/brcm/BCM4345C0.hcd

Copy waveform partition (via previously dumped file):

 adb root
 adb push waveform.img /cache/lib/firmware/waveform.bin

Or via dd within Linux:

 dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p3 of=/lib/firmware/waveform.bin bs=1k count=2048

==== Getting the Wifi and Bluetooth driver blobs from "other" sources

===== WiFi
The WiFi firmware .bin blob can be obtained by installing the Debian package firmware-brcm80211 (in the non-free section; in Bookworm and later it's in the non-free-firmware section)

The WiFi brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt file can according to Eugen be sourced from https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.AW-CM256SM.txt needs a renaming when copying it to /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt). The content of the upstream .txt is different than the Android configuration, but is supposed to work.

As you don't have WiFi yet you need to get the _firmware-brcm80211*.deb_ and _brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt_ file on the PineNote by other means, for instance using an USB stick

===== Bluetooth

Once you have WiFi working you can get BCM4345C0.hcd by installing the _bluez-firmware_:

 sudo apt install bluez-firmware

=== Configuring the E-ink refresh mode

* https://github.com/m-weigand/mw_pinenote_misc/tree/main/rockchip_ebc/patches contains information on how/where to write in _/sys_ to alter the refresh mode
* https://github.com/m-weigand/mw_pinenote_misc/tree/main/gnome_extension contains the gnome extension used in Maximilian image

=== Touchscreen and Pen In X.org

By default the pen config is flipped 180Â° (which makes it unusable) and the touchscreen doesn't work. Placing the following config in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-touchscreen.conf` will fix both problems:

 Section "InputClass"
     Identifier "evdev touchscreen"
     MatchProduct "tt21000"
     MatchIsTouchscreen "on"
     Driver        "evdev"
 EndSection
 Section "InputClass"
     Identifier    "RotateTouch"
     MatchProduct    "w9013"
     Option    "TransformationMatrix" "-1 0 1 0 -1 1 0 0 1"
 EndSection

=== Alternative to patching of mesa

Mesa needs to be patched to add the driver entry point. The alternative to this, is the renaming of the ebc driver to an existing mesa driver entry point. A good existing name can be "repaper". To change the driver name, edit in the kernel tree the following files:

* replace "rockchip-ebc" with "repaper" in the two places in the file: drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/rockchip_ebc.c
* preventive, replace "repaper" with "repaper-disabled" in the two places in the file: drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/repaper.c

=== Video of Factory Android OS

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWuTGgQHw98[PineNote Developer Edition w/Tech Demo Android OS (Video Only)]

Informal walkthrough of the factory Android installation on the PineNote Developer Edition, recorded by a community member (Apr 2022). This is useful to look back at the original OS after erasing it from your device, or to get some additional detail before your device arrives.

The video also includes a chapter at the end showing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWuTGgQHw98&t=802s[how to enable Android Debug Bridge ("adb") over USB]. Once enabled, keep the device powered and connect a USB cable directly to the PineNote (i.e. no UART breakout) to a computer running `adb`.
