The SOQuartz SoM does not have a lot of copper to sink heat into. Therefore, it’s recommended you use a heatsink such as the [Waveshare CM4 Heatsink](https://www.waveshare.com/product/accessories/power-heat-sinks/heat-sinks/cm4-heatsink.htm), the [other Waveshare CM4 Heatsink](https://www.waveshare.com/product/accessories/power-heat-sinks/heat-sinks/cm4-heatsink-b.htm), or the [PINE64 Small Fan Type Heatsink](https://pine64.com/product/small-fan-type-heatsink/). Please be aware that the Waveshare heatsinks may interfere with any eMMC module, unless you use very thick (2-3&nbsp;mm?) thermal pads. Local resellers may sell CM4 heatsinks or small stick-on heatsinks, so there’s no need to order them from abroad unless it’s cheaper.
	
Alternatively, or in addition to this, a rectangle-shaped piece of 1&nbsp;mm thick thermal pad can be sandwiched between the SoM and the carrier board. This allows the SoM to more efficiently sink heat into the larger mass of the base board.
