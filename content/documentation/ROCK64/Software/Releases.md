### Debian

![width=100](/documentation/images/Debian-logo.png)

**Debian** is an operating system and a distribution of Free Software.

Download:

* [Debian 11 Bullseye](https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bullseye/main/installer-arm64/current/images/netboot/SD-card-images/) (recommended)
* [Debian 12 Bookworm](https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bookworm/main/installer-arm64/current/images/netboot/SD-card-images/)
* [Daily netboot images](https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/arm64/)

Instructions:

* Go to the download directory
* Download firmware.rock64-rk3328.img.gz and partition.img.gz
* Combine the 2 parts into 1 image file: `zcat firmware.rock64-rk3328.img.gz partition.img.gz > debian-installer.img`
* Write the created .img file to microSD card or eMMC Module using _dd_: `dd if=debian-installer.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M`. Replace `/dev/sda` with your target drive.
* Plug the microSD/eMMC card in the Rock64 (and connect a serial console) and boot up to start the Debian Installer

Notes:

* An Ethernet connection is required for the above installer
* Remember to leave some space before your first partition for u-boot! You can do this by creating a 32M size unused partition at the start of the device.
* Auto creating all partitions does not work. You can use the following manual partition scheme:
```
#1 - 34MB  Unused/Free Space
#2 - 512MB ext2 /boot           (Remember to set the bootable flag)
#3 - xxGB  ext4 /               (This can be as large as you want. You can also create separate partitions for /home /var /tmp)
#4 - 1GB   swap                 (May not be a good idea if using an SD card)
```
* See [README.concatenateable_images here](https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/arm64/daily/netboot/SD-card-images/README.concatenateable_images) or [README.concatenateable_images here](https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bullseye/main/installer-arm64/current/images/netboot/SD-card-images/README.concatenateable_images) for details regarding the concatenateable images and their installation from non-Linux systems.
