Disassembling the charging case:

1. First open the lid and then try to press the case from the front edge with a plectrum or a thin card. There are two clips on each side. Soon the case will snap open.
2. Carefully unscrew and remove the PCB from the case.

Assembling the charging case:

1. Screw the PCB back into the place.
2. There is plenty of space, glue the coil to the bottom of the case.
3. Close the charging case.
