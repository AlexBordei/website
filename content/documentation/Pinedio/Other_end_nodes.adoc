There are several end-node units planned:

* loRa back case for the PinePhone
* standalone USB dongle-type end-node adapter
* PineTab adapter
* as well as a SPI module (which can also be configured as a USB LoRa dongle)
* a LoRa stick powered by a single 18650 battery (using the BL602, and can be fitted with GPS, an low-power OLED panel and additional sensors)

All the end-nodes use the SX1262 chip.
