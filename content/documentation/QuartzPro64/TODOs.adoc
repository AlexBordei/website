== Enable cpufreq Stuff

Current neggles kernel has the CPU at 1.2 GHz, apparently SRE has patches to enable cpufreq? (see in link:/documentation/QuartzPro64/Resources/#kernel[Resources])

== Add RK3588 Support To VOP2

VOP2 IP on the RK3588 is very similar to the one on the RK356x, but it still needs platform specific code added.
