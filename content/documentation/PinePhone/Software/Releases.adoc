This page contains a list of all available releases and tools for the link:/documentation/PinePhone[PinePhone] in alphabetical order.

NOTE: Some releases may not have a good setup for the backlight at low brightness. If configured too low, the backlight shuts down completely, but the screen is still displayed and usable in bright front-light.

See link:/documentation/PinePhone/Installation/[Installation instructions] on how to install the operating systems. Please see link:/documentation/PinePhone/Software/Updating_instructions[Update instructions] for how to update the phone.

=== openSUSE

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/SLEM-OS-logo.png" width="100" >}}

Our images use the same https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed[openSUSE Tumbleweed] base as our desktop images,
except what needs to be changed for the PinePhone.
The images include _zypper_ (RPM) as the default package manager,
and have access to virtually the same (open source) software as our desktop repositories,
thanks to the https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory[Factory] ports.
Using https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:DNF[dnf] is possible, if preferred.

To verify the images you need to import https://build.opensuse.org/projects/devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:PinePhone/public_key[our GPG key].
Keep on mind that the first boot may stay on black screen for about a minute - consequent boots should be faster.

You can find install instructions at https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:PinePhone#Installing_openSUSE_in_a_Pinephone[this section] in the openSUSE Wiki.

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/SailfishOS_logo.png" width="100" >}}

https://sailfishos.org/[Sailfish OS] is a Linux-based operating system based on open source projects such as https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Main_Page[Mer], and a closed source UI based on https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Lipstick[Lipstick].

* https://gitlab.com/pinephone-sailfish-os/linux-kernel/[Linux kernel config repo]
* https://gitlab.com/sailfishos-porters-ci/dont_be_evil-ci/[Sailfish OS repo]

==== Download

*Flashing script*

The Sailfish OS image is built on Gitlab CI. The latest image can be installed using the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sailfish-on-dontbeevil/flash-it/master/flash-it.sh[flashing script].

The script downloads the image and bootloader from the CI, extracts everything and burns it onto the SD card.

NOTE: The script will format and erase the SD card!

Instructions:

. Download the flashing script
. Insert a microSD card in your device
. Make the script executable: `chmod +x flash-it.sh`
. Verify that you have the `bsdtar` package installed
. Execute it: `./flash-it.sh`
. Follow the instructions. Some commands in the script require root permissions (for example: mounting and flashing the SD card).

When asked where to flash, type 'raw' and it will build the image on your computer. Otherwise define the path */dev/[...]*. to flash to card or internal emmc.

*username/password*

Set PIN on initialization.

==== Notes

* Sometimes the first run stalls before the tutorial. Reboot and it will start from setting the security pin.
* The homescreen may be locked unless you boot with a sim card inserted. An old expired sim will do. *If you do not have a SIM card on hands, do NOT set a security code on first boot.*
* When a screen with a loading circle is displayed, just left/right swipe it away.
* If you're not familiar with Sailfish OS, pay attention to the tutorial - the interface works great, but is not immediately obvious. If you are familiar with it, you can skip the tutorial by touching all 4 corners starting top left.

*What works, what does not work*

See the https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/PinePhone64#Hardware_Support[Hardware Support section] on the Mer Wiki's PinePhone Page.

There is a limited selection of apps available from the Jolla store, the vast majority are hosted on openrepos.net. If the Storeman app for openrepos is not preinstalled, download the RPM and click to install.

*Notes*

OTA is supported: `zypper refresh && zypper update` as root (`devel-su` to get root access). Things that need reflash are bootloader specific at the moment. If improvements like link:/documentation/PinePhone/Software/Crust[Crust] or changes of partition layout are added, then you need to reflash.

== Tools

There are software tools, that can be booted on the PinePhone.

=== JumpDrive

JumpDrive can be used to flash the eMMC (and the microSD card), see link:/documentation/PinePhone/Installation/Installation_to_the_eMMC/#using_jumpdrive[Installation instructions].

See https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases for the latest image.
Make sure to download the "PinePhone" image and to unpack the archive before flashing.

=== Tow-Boot

Tow-Boot is a more user-friendly distribution of U-Boot. Can also mount internal storage as USB Mass Storage by holding the volume up button at startup before and during the second vibration and the LED will turn blue if done successfully.

See https://github.com/Tow-Boot/Tow-Boot/releases for the latest image.
Make sure to download the image with pinephoneA64 in the name.

== Hardware test build

WARNING: The factorytest image for hardware testing appears to be no longer maintained.

On the Braveheart model, there was a postmarketOS based basic Factory Test OS pre-installed on the eMMC. The developer Martijn Braam from postmarketOS has improved the functionality of the image considerably later. Since the 20200501 version, it is able to test all the hardware. It also includes functionality to install a new OS to the eMMC when using with an test image that includes that OS image. The downloadable image just does the hardware tests. Do not flash eMMC to test your device, just flash it to microSD and test from there. New versions are distributed as part of the postmarketOS distribution.

NOTE: The magnetometer test will fail on the new Beta Edition, as the factory image wasn't updated for it yet.

== Historic factory builds

These are different operating system builds that was preloaded in the factory with testing utility.

Download the build, extract the image and dd it to a 8 GB or larger microSD card, then insert it into the PinePhone.
After power up or reboot, you may perform and complete the test routine, or apply the build from microSD card to eMMC.

All the download links below are direct download from pine64.org.

WARNING: These images are for testing purposes only. If you are looking for an up-to-date image please select one from the
software releases section instead.

Ready-to-use system image available on the https://genode.org/download/sculpt[download page].

== Installing other ARM64 distributions

Other ARM64 distributions might be installed as well, however this requires some tinkering and may not work well.

[NOTE]
====
Distributions not on this page may not even boot after you follow this section. In the best case, they will be barely usable.
This is more for fun, or if you would like to port a new distribution to the PinePhone.
====

General steps:

. Create a boot partition (from 4 MB to about 252 MB) and a root partition (from the end of boot to the end of the card) filesystem on the SD card.
. Format the boot partition with vfat, and the root partition with a supported filesystem like ext4 or f2fs.
. Extract the root filesystem from your distribution's ARM image into the root filesystem on the SD card. Do not copy the partition, copy the files instead (in archive mode, like `rsync -ar`).
. Edit `/etc/fstab` to match your partitions.
. Grab megi's kernel from https://xff.cz/kernels/, Follow the instructions in the https://xff.cz/kernels/README[README], which involves copying the kernel modules into the SD card rootfs, and writing u-boot and the bootloader.

If you would like to see examples or specific commands for how to complete these steps, see:
