== Main Board

=== Sim Reader

The sim reader may fail to read a sim card (reporting 'sim-missing' in mmcli), possibly due to deformed pins (if you put your sim adapter in without a sim), or due to a warped sim card adapter.

A possible solution is to bend the pins back (using a plastic spudger), and/or use a different sim card adapter (which your carrier may provide to you).

== USB-C Side Board

All USB-C Side Board issues can be fixed by replacing the https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-usb-c-side-board/[USB-C Side Board]

=== Internal Microphone

The microphone may stop working or occasionally stop working or give off static when power is plugged in.

One possible fix is to User:Earboxer/Shim_U101|shim U101 (as seen on the https://files.pine64.org/doc/PinePhone/PinePhone%20USB-C%20small%20board%20bottom%20placement%20v1.0%2020190730.pdf[back side of the USB-C Side Board]) with a piece of paper or cardboard.

=== Bottom Speaker

The bottom speaker may stop working, especially if you have recently mishandled the USB-C Side Board, stressing the point of connection between the circuit board and the circuit flex. This can be fixed by touching up the solder between the two.
