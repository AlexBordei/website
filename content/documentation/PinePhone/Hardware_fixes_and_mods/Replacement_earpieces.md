The earpiece (or earpiece speaker) refers to the small speaker at the top of the ***PinePhone*** and ***PinePhone Pro***.

This part is not available to purchase from the PINE64 Store. However, it is possible to buy a replacement earpiece for another device, and install it in a PinePhone or PinePhone Pro. This documents earpieces that have been tested by the community, and verified to work.

Note that the earpiece dimensions for both the PinePhone and PinePhone Pro are 12x6x2 mm. When looking into earpieces not found in this list, aim for these dimensions.
