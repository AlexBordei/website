* Run `dd if=[image file] of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=10M` (example: _sudo dd if=slack-current-aarch64-xfce_29Sep18-4.4.162-rockpro64-build-20181126.img of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=10M_)
* then edit these two files in eMMC module:
** `mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /media`
** `echo "rootdev=/dev/mmcblk1p1" >> /media/boot/uEnv.txt`

=== Void Linux

*Void Linux* is a general purpose operating system, based on the monolithic Linux kernel. The official guide can be found at https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/arm-devices/index.html[Guide]. At this time there are no RockPro64 images available.

The following creates a bootable image from an existing Void Linux installation:

* `xbps-insall -Syu` to update the xbps installation of the installation
* create ROCKPro64 image with the _void-mklive_ software (from github.com):
** create a rootfs via _mkrootfs.sh_: `sh mkrootfs.sh -o void-aarch64-muls-ROOTFS-yyyymmdd.tar.xz`
** `sh mkplatformfs.sh rockpro64 void-aarch64-muls-ROOTFS-yyyymmdd.tar.xz`
** `sh mkimage.sh -s 7GiB void-rockpro64-PLATFORMFS-yyyymmdd.tar.xz`
* write image to sdcard or eMMC: `dd if=*IMAGE-FILENAME* of=*DEVICENAME* bs=2M`
* If _mkplatformfs.sh_ errors with _ROCKPro64 not supported_, install _xbps-src_ from https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages and build the ROCKPro64 package.
* Tip:  write a new U-Boot to the image if you see on the serial console the boot-up stalls:
** get the two U-Boot files from https://pkgs.org/download/u-boot-rockpro64[pkgs.org], the aarch64 files:
** `dd if=idbloader.img of=DEVICENAME seek=64`
** `dd if=u-boot.itb of=DEVICENAME seek=16384`
