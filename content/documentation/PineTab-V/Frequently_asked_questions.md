_What is the Performance of the PineTab2 compared to the PineTab-V?_

The PineTab2 is notably faster than the PineTab-V. You can see this by [comparing the Quartz64 sbc-bench results to the Star64 ones](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/master/Results.md). Performance should not be a factor of consideration when purchasing a PineTab-V.
