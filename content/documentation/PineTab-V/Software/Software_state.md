The PineTab-V is an experimental device and lacks dedicated working software – it should therefore only be purchased by people interested in helping with the bring-up process of Linux and BSDs on the RISC-V architecture. 

**⚠️ WARNING**\
Do not buy the device unless you intend to use it for operating system development purposes.
