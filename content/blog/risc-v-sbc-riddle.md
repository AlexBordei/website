### Latin slant

Under the scorching sun

An old Roman senator sat 

Studying it all 

And slowly came to realize that

He bears witness to the empire’s fall

And so began his intricate plan

For the imminent end

So savage and so cruel        

Was this strive to mend  

It lay waste to the Roman rule

_**\***The winner will receive the first production version of the SBC. Prototype devices destined for developers will ship first. 
_

_The Pine Store cannot ship to countries under international embargo (North Korea, Iran, etc.,)_.
