Mobian Community Edition (CE) PinePhones are now available for [**pre-order**](https://pine64.com/product-category/smartphones/) in the Pine Store. This edition of the PinePhone ships with Mobian, a Debian-based Linux distribution tailored to run on smartphones. The project came to life on our platform and has now grown to become one of the community favorites.  

To learn more about the Mobian please visit the [project’s website](https://mobian-project.org/). To better understand the state of the software and what to expect when you get your unit, I encourage you to [read the development team’s blog](https://blog.mobian-project.org/posts/2021/01/15/mobian-community-edition/) post on this subject matter. 

This community edition will ship in a custom presentation box designed by Mobian’s team, and the PinePhone itself will feature a Debian swirl logo on the back-cover (see renders for reference).

This PinePhone CE will be available in two hardware configurations:

- **$149 — 2GB RAM; 16GB eMMC**
- **$199 — 3GB RAM; 32GB eMMC (includes a bundled USB-C dock)**

Both configurations of the Mobian CE PinePhones feature rev. 1.2b of the PCBA. The $199 hardware variant, called _convergence package_, also includes a USB-C dock equipped with 10/100 Ethernet, 2x USB type A ports, HDMI digital video output and power-in via USB-C.

**We will donate $10 per unit sold to** **Mobian**. To learn more about this scheme please [click here](https://www.pine64.org/2019/08/19/its-time-to-start-giving-back/).
