Hello everyone,

I'm sure many of you will be happy to hear that the next round of Pinebook Pro pre-orders have now opened. This production-run is expected to ship in late August, 2020. Both ISO and ANSI keyboards are available. If the Pinebook Pro is something you've been waiting for,Â  then click the button below.

In case you missed it, we've had some [big announcements](https://www.pine64.org/2020/07/15/july-updatepmos-ce-pre-orders-and-new-pinephone-version/) earlier this month.

Have a lovely day and a great start to the week!
