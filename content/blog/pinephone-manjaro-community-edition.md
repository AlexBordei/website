I am thrilled to announce that the next _Community Edition_ (CE) of the PinePhone will feature [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). For those of you who do not know, Manjaro is an Arch-based Linux operating system designed with user-friendliness in mind. But Manjaro is more than just an operating system, it is also a large and vibrant community of contributors and end-users, which I highly encourage you to [join](https://forum.manjaro.org/).

Manjaro has offered support for PINE64 devices since the very beginning - with high-quality OS builds now available for nearly all our SBCs and devices - and the PinePhone is no exception in this regard. There are currently three Manjaro PinePhone build variants (Lomiri, Phosh and Plasma Mobile) for users to try out - all available for download from Manjaro’s [downloads repository](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-arm/storage/pinephone/).

To learn more about Manjaro's plans for their edition of the PinePhone, please read the complimentary [announcement post on](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/18369) their forum.

This community edition will ship in a custom presentation box designed by Manjaro’s development team, and the PinePhone itself will feature a sleek-looking Manjaro logo on the back-cover (see renders for reference).

This PinePhone CE will be available in two hardware configurations:

- **$149 -- 2GB RAM; 16GB eMMC**
    
- **$199 -- 3GB RAM; 32GB eMMC (includes a bundled USB-C dock)**
    

Both configurations of the Manjaro CE PinePhones feature rev. 1.2a PCBA, introduced with postmarketOS CE that is currently shipping. The $199 hardware variant, called _convergence package_, also features a USB-C dock equipped with 10/100 Ethernet, 2x USB type A ports, HDMI digital video output and power-in via USB-C.

We will donate $10 per unit sold to the Manjaro development team. To learn more about this scheme please [click here](https://www.pine64.org/2019/08/19/its-time-to-start-giving-back/).
