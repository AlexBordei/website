I am pleased to announce that pre-orders for the PinePhone BETA Edition will **open on March 24**. The PinePhone BETA Edition is powered by **[KDE Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/)** and **[Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)**.

To learn more about the BETA Edition please read the [March Community Update](https://www.pine64.org/2021/03/15/march-update/). 

PinePhone BETA Edition will be made available in two hardware configurations:

- **$149 — 2GB RAM; 16GB eMMC**
- **$199 — 3GB RAM; 32GB eMMC (includes a USB-C dock)**

Both configurations feature the newest PCBA revision (1.2b). The $199 hardware variant, called _convergence package_, also includes a USB-C dock equipped with 10/100 Ethernet, 2x USB type A ports, HDMI digital video output and power-in via USB-C.
