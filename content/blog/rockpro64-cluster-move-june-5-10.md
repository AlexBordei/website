The process of moving our end-user services to the ROCKPro64 cluster will be taking place in the coming days (5-10 June). I am not going to pretend like this is the best time for the move to be taking place, since it is not. Many users are relying on our infrastructure for information and community support, particular now that people are receiving their devices and many more are waiting for their units to ship. But things are what they are, and we have a strict deadline we need to adhere to.

In practice, this means that at different times during this move key parts of the infrastructure will be down. This includes: the forum, the Wiki, the chats bridge and IRC,Â  portions of the support system, PINE Installer mirrors as well as this website. It is not possible for me to say with certainty when exactly each of these community-facing services will be moved nor how long it will be down for. Obviously we'll aim to complete the process as quickly and painlessly as possible but unpredictable things can, and likely will, happen.

I'll do my best to give you a heads-up when portions of the system are scheduled to go down for maintenance on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thepine64) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@PINE64). I'll also issue notices in the [news section](https://forum.pine64.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=2) of the forums.

Lastly, I'd like to note that the [PINE store](https://pine64.com/) and [ticket filing system](http://support.pine64.org), as well as our info and support emails will remain operational though the entire server move.

Thank you in advance for your patience.

**\[edit June 11, 2020\]** All key community based infrastructure has now been moved to the cluster. Moreover, the move went went surprisingly well and without any major hiccup.

In the coming weeks and months we'll be adding more services to the cluster. I have already spoken to FireTwoOneNine about writing a short blog post about the cluster, its present utilization and future applications in the project.

Lastly, I'd like to thank all those who offered advise and were directly involved in this project.
