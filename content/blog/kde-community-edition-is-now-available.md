We are pleased to announce that the KDE Community Edition (CE) PinePhone is now available for [**pre-order**.](https://pine64.com/product-category/smartphones/) This edition of the PinePhone ships with a tailored build of Plasma Mobile built upon Manjaro Linux, and it is the culmination of ongoing efforts to bring the popular _Plasma_ desktop environment to the smartphone. 

To learn more about Plasma Mobile please visit [the project’s website](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/). To better understand your options for running Plasma Mobile on the PinePhone and the current state of development (at the time of writing) I encourage you to read the development team's [blog post](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/2020/12/01/pinephone-kde-community-edition.html) on this subject matter.  

This community edition will ship in a custom presentation box designed by the Plasma Mobile team, and the PinePhone itself will feature a KDE logo on the back-cover (see renders for reference).

This PinePhone CE will be available in two hardware configurations:

- **$149 — 2GB RAM; 16GB eMMC**
- **$199 — 3GB RAM; 32GB eMMC (includes a bundled USB-C dock)**

Both configurations of the KDE CE PinePhones feature rev. 1.2b PCBA. The $199 hardware variant, called _convergence package_, also features a USB-C dock equipped with 10/100 Ethernet, 2x USB type A ports, HDMI digital video output and power-in via USB-C.

We will donate $10 per unit sold to [KDE e.V.](https://ev.kde.org/) To learn more about this scheme please [click here](https://www.pine64.org/2019/08/19/its-time-to-start-giving-back/).
