Nutcracker challenge: Working towards blob-free WiFi and BLE. Get your EVB now free. <!--more-->

![](/contests/images/Nutcracker.png)

Although it's the end of _Hacktoberfest_, it's not too late for an open source nut cracking challenge. This is a challenge that will benefit not only our current and future devices but also the community moving forward.

So, what is the challenge then? To achieve blob-free BL602 for the open source community so that we all can enjoy blob-free FOSS Bluetooth and WiFi on PINE64 devices. 

If you want to get in on the action and to receive a BL602 evaluation board (EVB) - which we have codenamed **PineCone** - with the BL602 shipped to you, here are the steps to follow: 

**Unfortunately, the challenge already ended.**

<!--
The following also works:

**Step 1:** Register or login to github.com

**Step 2:** Contribute to one of following repositories: [BL602 SDK](https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk), [BL602 Documentation](https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs) or [BL602 Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re)

**Step 3**: Check if your pull request was accepted

**Step 4:** Follow instructions on your pull request or sign up for free PineCone [here](https://nutcracker.pine64.org/free-evb/)

**Step 5**: We will reach out to you via email for your shipping details

**Step 6:** Wait to receive the PineCone (EVB with BL602)!

Anyone can participate in this _Nutcracker_ campaign but we only have a limited amount (approx 1000 pcs) of EVBs available, so if many people choose to take part then we’ll have to prioritise the kits based on a common-sense first-come-first-served basis. Let’s do this!
